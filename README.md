#[Redu.se](http://redu.se)
Redu.se is a simple URL shortener, designed to allow the user to reduse the length of a URL that they wish to send to someone, or print out and have people be able to easily type into their web browser.

##About
Redu.se is written entirely in the [Go](http://golang.org) programming language, and makes use of the following 3rd party packages:
* [Web.go](http://webgo.io) for a simplified web app framework
* [Captcha](http://github.com/dchest/captcha) for generating and verifing [CAPTCHA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA)s to prevent spamming
* [Go-MySQL-Driver](github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql) as a MySQL Driver for Go's [database/sql](http://golang.org/pkg/database/sql) package
* [GoRelic](http://github.com/yvasiyarov/gorelic) for integration with [NewRelic](http://newrelic.com) for app performance statistics



More information to come, this is still an early work in progress
